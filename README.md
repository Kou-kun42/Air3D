# Final Project
<i>Make School SPD 1.5</i>

This is a website made with the Bootstrap framework. The site is for Air3D, a service that I proposed in this Medium post: https://medium.com/@gobindpuniani/air3d-accelerating-the-consumer-3d-printing-revolution-79aca3dd9eb. 

UPDATE: This project now also includes dynamic components, such as tooltips for some of the links on the homepage and modals for confirming submission on the pages with forms.
